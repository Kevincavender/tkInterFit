Welcome to tkInterFit, an example of creating a
cross-platform curve and surface fitting application 
using tkinter and the pyeq3 fitting library.

Step 1: Install Python 3, tk, scipy and matplotlib

On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can use this command:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

On other operating systems, try the Canopy Express Free version:

Step 2: Install the pyeq3 fitting library with pip

From a command prompt, run the command

pip3 install pyeq3



Step 3: Run the tkInterFit example

From a command prompt run this command:

python3 FittingInterface.py



Step 4: Celebrate

You are now curve and surface fitting data using tkinter!
